 
 1. Methodology testing guide : The method of testing and rule set which is helpful for testers :
 
      - OSSTMM (open source security testing methodology manual)
      
      - OWASP testing guide 
 
 2. Burp suit simple XSS test with already available list of payload : 
 
      
      - Download the default payload list : "git clone https://github.com/atulgrayhat/xss-custom-payload"
      
      - intercept the request of any web into burp
      
      - send to intruder --> intruder --> select posotion --> add list --> start attack --> done.
      
      - here you get the result of thst attack.
      
  2.1 : Quiz 1 : Answer :
  
      -1. vulnerability assesment 
      
      -2. Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks
      
 3. Remote code execution using shell upload :
 
      - Uploading PHP shell on web where upload parameter open : 
      
      - Download PHP shell from : r57 shell (web)
      
      - go to web that you want to check
      
      - intercept the request to burp
      
      - send to repeater
      
      - here you see the result after execution
      
      - copy that address OR href for and checkt that the result and execution
      
      - gives you the very big screen with all the credential about it.(database/ user/ version/     etc...)
      
 4. Quiz 2 : Answer 
      
      - 1 : Sending a variety of inputs to identify security vulnerabilities
      
      - 2 : Firing up burp suit
      
 5. DVWA/ Mutillidae/ OWASP --> ( you can find more about that on internet)
 
 6. Nmap : Network scanner (Basic)
      -F : for fast scan
 
      - nmap -sS -Pn "ip"  --> open ports/ services
      
      - nmap -sT -Pn "ip"  --> tcp scan  
      
      - nmap -sF -Pn "ip"  --> finish scan (filter packets scan)
      
      - nmap -O -Pn "ip"   --> OS scan 
      
      - nmap -sV "ip"  --> version detection each ports
      
      - nmap -sS -p T:21 U:35 "ip"  --> for particular port ( Tcp/ Udp.... )
      
      - nmap -sT -p1-100 "ip"  --> scan particular port range
      
 7. script scanning : find vulnerabilities on target system
 
      - nmap --script=default "ip"  --> vulnerabilities on host
      
 8. Quiz 3 : Answer
 
      -1 : To scan for open ports and services on a network
      
      -2 : SYN scan
      
 9. Firewall, IDS Evasion with NMAP - Pentesting
 
      - nmap -f "ip"  --> check  for the fragmentation of data
      
         -detect firewall / IDS system
      
      - nmap --mtu 64 "ip" --> devide data into 64 portion
      
      - nmap -Pn -sI 1.1.1.1:1024 "ip" --> ideal scan (1.1.... --> fack ip for increment)
      
      - nmap -D 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,127.0.0.1 "ip"  --> decoy scan (four host scaning the ip and confused what is going on)
      
      - nmap --spoof-nac "fake_mac_add" "ip"  -->it will be spoof your mac with given fack mac 
      
      - nmap -S -Pn "fake_ip" "ip"  --> hide your ip with fake
      
      
 10. Firewall, IDS Evasion with NMAP - Pentesting - Firewall Evasion
 
      -NOTE : you can find all scan type in nmap --help
 
      - Nmap "SYN" scan technique is stealth in nature (half open connect)
      
      - TCP connect scan technique makes direct connection to the target
      
      - XMAS scan randomizes the data packets to scan, like "X-mas Tree"
         this scan is stelthy nature
         
      - we have to scan all the swithes and technique because we don't know which type of security detection/ IDS/ IPS OR firewall they use
      
      - nmap -sS "ip" 
      
      - nmap -sT "ip" -Pn
      
      - nmap -sX "ip" -Pn
         
      - nmap -f "ip" -Pn
      
      - nmap --mtu -sT "ip" -Pn -p123  (mtu - maximum transfer unit and p123 is theport number that i want to scan particular because that one port still filtered by firewall so itry fragment so may be firewall does'nt understand what happening)
      
      - nmap -sN "ip" -Pn
      
      - nmap -sM "ip" -Pn
      
      - nmap -sW "ip" -Pn
      
      - nmap -sW "ip" -Pn -p123 -sV
      
      - you will find or bypass the firewall or security system with this anyone scan also many scan awailable into manual page of nmap
      
      *** Tips And reference :
       
       - NMAP can bypass even highly secured filtering mechanisms.
       
       - practice to bypass your own systems with firewall ON.
       
       - spoofing source ip, mac and port number may also bypass.
       
       - port 80 or 8080 is neglected in many case by firewall, so try with spoofing "source port" set 80 or 8080 with nmap.
